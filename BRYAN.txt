BRYAN by Shel SilversteinBRYAN loves me,BRYAN cares,BRYAN picks me peaches and pears.BRYAN offers me candy and Cokes,BRYAN listens and laughs at me jokes.BRYAN helps when I get in a fight,BRYAN does all my homework at night.BRYAN misses me,BRYAN cries,BRYAN thinks I'm a wonderful guy.So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,I'll stand up and tell you that BRYAN is.But yesterday night I got quite a scare,I woke up and BRYAN just wasn't there.I called out and reached out for BRYAN's hand,In the darkness where BRYAN usually stands.Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,But I found somebody each place that I looked.I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,There's no doubt about it-BRYAN's gone!
